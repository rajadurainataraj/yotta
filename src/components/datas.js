          Companies often combine traditional and digital marketing techniques

          digital channels to market products and services in order to reach

          mobile devices, social media, search engines, and other similar
          channels.Smartphones and other digital devices are now making it
          easier for companies to market themselves along with their products
          and services to consumers. Studies show that people prefer using
          their phones to log on to the internet. So it should come as no
